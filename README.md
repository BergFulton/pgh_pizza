##Pittsburgh Pizza map!
The only guide to the 'Burgh's best pizza you need. 

###What is this? 
A leading group of eminent yinzers (that's native Pittsburghers, if you didn't know) have come together over some 
Ahrn Cities and yelled a lot until we came up with a list of the BEST pizza places in the city. 

So we decided that we weren't going to be jag offs, and that we were going to share this knowledge with everyone. 

This was made using that Google Maps API and the Foursquare API to provide yinz with up to date information on when and where yinz can get pizza. 

###How do I use it? 
Yinz can fork or clone this repo, then open up `index.html` and that's that. 

###Who helped yinz with this?
This project was made possible through the help of Udacity mentors Sarah Maris, Ryan Vrba, Karol, and many others in the Udacity program. 

Help also came from [Pat Fulton](http://www.github.com/pfulton).

Also very useful was [this blog post](http://www.knockmeout.net/2011/04/utility-functions-in-knockoutjs.html) from Ryan and Knockmeout.net and the Knockout.js documentation on [the visible binding](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/visible-binding.html).
